# Hello!

I am [Robert Sundling](https://bsky.app/profile/robertsundling.bsky.social), a solo game developer and retro enthusiast. I've been programming since 1983 and have been making indie games since the DOS days.

Today I'm still creating new software for vintage systems. I also have a huge catalog of 40 years' worth of software that I've created for my own use, which I'm slowly working through and pushing out to GitHub. Some of these repositories, so far, include:

* [ADVGEN](https://github.com/RobertSundling/ADVGEN) - Vintage text adventure compiler and interpreter written in QuickBASIC
* [Newton-PKGDUMP](https://github.com/RobertSundling/Newton-PKGDUMP) - Tool for analyzing Apple Newton .PKG files, including a NewtonScript bytecode disassembler
* [costar-xl-to-ii-converter](https://github.com/RobertSundling/costar-xl-to-ii-converter) - Vintage tool to convert raw CoStar LabelWriter XL printer data to LabelWriter II Plus format
* [xmas93](https://github.com/RobertSundling/xmas93) - Vintage DOS/VGA Christmas Animation from 1993
* [qb-wordsearch](https://github.com/RobertSundling/qb-wordsearch) - Vintage word search generator written in QuickBASIC

If my name sounds familiar, you may know me from my [Shareware games from the 1990s](https://www.zensoft.com/games-legacy). I also build [software and hardware to enable physics discoveries and run scientific laboratories](https://www.zensoft.com).
