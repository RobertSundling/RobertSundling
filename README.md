# Hello!

I am [Robert Sundling](https://bsky.app/profile/robertsundling.bsky.social), a solo game developer and retro enthusiast. I've been programming since 1983 and have been making indie games since the DOS days.

Today I'm still creating new software for vintage systems. I also have a huge catalog of 40 years worth of software that I've created for my own use, which I'm slowly working through and pushing out to GitHub.

If my name sounds familiar, you may know me from my [Shareware games from the 1990s](https://www.zensoft.com/games-legacy). I also build [software and hardware to enable physics discoveries and run scientific laboratories](https://www.zensoft.com).
